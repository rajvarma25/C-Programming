<p class="text-center" style="font-family: 'Yanone Kaffeesatz', sans-serif;font-size:25px">C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, while a static type system prevents unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions and has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computers, from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.

<kbd>Procedural Language</kbd> - Instructions in a C program are executed step by step.
<p><kbd>Portable</kbd> - You can move C programs from one platform to another, and run it without any or minimal changes.</p>
<p><kbd>Speed</kbd> - C programming is faster than most programming languages like Java, Python, etc.</p>
<p><kbd>General Purpose</kbd> - C programming can be used to develop operating systems, embedded systems, databases, and so on.</p>

<kbd>Why Learn C Programming?</kbd>
<p>C helps you to understand the internal architecture of a computer, how computer stores and retrieves information.
After learning C, it will be much easier to learn other programming languages like Java, Python, etc.
Opportunity to work on open source projects. Some of the largest open-source projects such as Linux kernel, Python interpreter, SQLite database, etc. are written in C programming.

<h1 class="text-center">Introduction to <kbd>Flow Control</kbd> in <kbd>C</kbd> Programming</h1>
</div>
<p>
Very few programs follow exactly one control path and have each instruction stated explicitly. In order to program effectively, it is necessary to understand how one can alter the steps taken by a program due to user input or other conditions, how some steps can be executed many times with few lines of code, and how programs can appear to demonstrate a rudimentary grasp of logic. C constructs known as conditionals and loops grant this power. 
From this point forward, it is necessary to understand what is usually meant by the word block. A block is a group of code statements that are associated and intended to be executed as a unit. In C, the beginning of a block of code is denoted with { (left curly), and the end of a block is denoted with }. It is not necessary to place a semicolon after the end of a block. Blocks can be empty, as in { }. Blocks can also be nested; i.e. there can be blocks of code within larger blocks.

<h1 class="text-center">Introduction to <kbd>Functions</kbd> in <kbd>C</kbd> Programming</h1>
</div>
<p>
A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example, strcat() to concatenate two strings, memcpy() to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.
A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.

<h1 class="text-center">Introduction to <kbd>Arrays</kbd> in <kbd>C</kbd> Programming</h1>
</div>
<p>
An array is a collection of data items, all of the same type, accessed using a common name.
A one-dimensional array is like a list;  A two dimensional array is like a table;  The C language places no limits on the number of dimensions in an array, though specific implementations may.
Some texts refer to one-dimensional arrays as vectors, two-dimensional arrays as matrices, and use the general term arrays when the number of dimensions is unspecified or unimportant.

</div>
<p>
Pointers in C language is a variable that stores/points the address of another variable. A Pointer in C is used to allocate memory dynamically i.e. at run time. The pointer variable might be belonging to any of the data type such as int, float, char, double, short etc.
Pointer Syntax : data_type *var_name; Example : int *p;  char *p;</p>
<p>Where, * is used to denote that “p” is pointer variable and not a normal variable.

<p>
C Strings are nothing but array of characters ended with null character (‘\0’).
This null character indicates the end of the string.
Strings are always enclosed by double quotes. Whereas, character is enclosed by single quotes in C.

<p>
<kbd>Structures in C</kbd>
</p>
<p>
A structure is a user-defined data type available in C that allows to combining data items of different kinds. Structures are used to represent a record.
Defining a structure: To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than or equal to one member. 
</p>
<p><kbd>Unions in C</kbd></p>
<p> A union is a special data type available in C that allows storing different data types in the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple purposes.</p>
<p>To define a union, you must use the union statement in the same way as you did while defining a structure. The union statement defines a new data type with more than one member for your program.</p>
